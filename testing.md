Extensive testing was carried out throughout the entire development process. In addition to the documented tests outlined below, I gathered feedback from friends and family by having them navigate the site to identify areas that worked well and any issues that needed addressing. I also thoroughly tested the site myself, manually clicking through each feature and function to pinpoint any malfunctions or errors appearing in the console.

If I had more time, I would have implemented automated testing using Jest and Django's testing framework, which is something I plan to explore further in future projects.

In practice, a combination of manual and automated testing is crucial for production code. Automated tests offer speed, especially in large-scale applications, while manual testing helps evaluate the user experience and design intuition. Using both approaches ensures the highest level of quality and reliability for web applications.

### Lighthouse

Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools was utilised to assess the website's performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

| No. | Bug | How I solved the issue |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The server could not be started due to a ModuleNotFoundError for the settings module. This issue occurred because Django generated two nested folders (both named katiekate), causing the settings.py file to be placed in a subfolder, which prevented the application from locating it. | Moved the contents of the subfolder to the main katiekate folder.  This allowed Django to locate and load the settings properly, resolving the error and enabling the server to run successfully. |
| 2 | `NameError: name 'get_object_or_404' is not defined`.The error occurred because the `get_object_or_404` function was not imported in `views.py`, causing the product details page not to load properly.
| Added the following import at the top of the views.py file - 'from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404' |
| 3 | Link badges for Categories not being displayed. This was traced back to the categories variable being initially set to None causing it to be empty when passed to the template. 
As a result, no category badges were rendered. | To resolve this, the code was modified to ensure that all categories are fetched and passed to the template by default when no category filter is applied in the URL query string. Specifically, if no category filter is present in the request, the code now explicitly fetches all categories from the database using Category.objects.all() and assigns them to the categories variable. |
| 4 | The shopping bag icon within the nav-bar wasnâ€™t clickable, and the cursor didnâ€™t change to the hand (pointer) on hover. The issue was due to the HTML structure. The shopping bag icon was nested inside a non-interactive div element without being properly wrapped in a clickable element like an <a> tag. This prevented the browser from recognizing the element as a link, which in turn caused the hand cursor to not appear.| The code now correctly uses an anchor tag to wrap both the icon and the price details, ensuring both are interactive and the hand cursor appears as expected. |
| 5 |The bag.html template was not rendering when accessing the shopping bag page, and the page was either showing a 404 error or failing to display the expected content. The root cause of the issue was that the bag app had not been added to the INSTALLED_APPS list in the Django settings.py file. Without this inclusion, Django was unaware of the app, which meant that it didn't load the templates or views associated with the app. | : To resolve this issue, we added the bag app to the INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.py file, ensuring that Django correctly recognizes the app, loads its templates, and processes its views.|
| 6 | TemplateDoesNotExist error occurred when trying to load products/includes/quantity_input_script.html, which was caused by the includes/ folder being placed outside the templates/ directory. This prevented the template from being found and rendered properly. | The issue was resolved by moving the includes/ folder inside the templates/products/ directory, ensuring the correct file path and structure for template rendering. Always verify that template files are in the correct directories according to Django's template loader system.|
| 7 | CSS was used to apply a pointer cursor to the .update-link and .remove-item buttons, but it did not work because the <a> elements lacked an href attribute, causing browsers to treat them as non-clickable text. As a result, the cursor remained the default text selection style instead of changing to a pointer. | To resolve this, href="javascript:void(0);" was added, ensuring the links were recognized as interactive elements without causing navigation. This worked because browsers require an href for <a> tags to be interactive, and javascript:void(0); prevents any unintended redirection while allowing JavaScript functionality. |
| 8 | After adding a UserProfile model to the profiles app and linking it to the User model, I encountered an issue where logging out of the admin panel prevented me from logging back in, showing the error: "RelatedObjectDoesNotExist: User has no userprofile." This occurred because the admin user, created before the UserProfile model was introduced, didnâ€™t have a UserProfile associated with their account. | To resolve this, I manually linked the admin user to a UserProfile using the Django shell (python manage.py shell). Once the profile was created, I was able to log back in. Going forward, I ensured that the post_save signal was properly set up to automatically create a UserProfile for all new users. |
| 9 | Resolved issue where orders were not found for UserProfile due to a missing migration. | The Order model was updated to include a ForeignKey to UserProfile, and makemigrations + migrate were run to apply the change. The profile view was adjusted to fetch orders correctly using Order.objects.filter(user_profile=profile), preventing the AttributeError. |
| 10 | the view for displaying products with special offers was returning all products, even those without any special offer assigned. This was because the initial query used Product.objects.all(), which fetched all products regardless of whether they had a special offer | To resolve this, the query was modified to filter products from the beginning by including only those that have a special offer assigned, using Product.objects.filter(special_offer__isnull=False). This ensures that only products with a valid special offer are included in the view. Additionally, when a specific special offer (such as "New Arrivals", "Deals", or "Clearance") is provided in the URL, the view further filters the products to display only those linked to the selected special offer.|
| 11 | when logged in the checkout page is not showing the return to profile button as expected |The "Return to Profile" button wasn't working because the from_profile variable, which determines whether the button should be displayed, was not being passed to the template context in the checkout_success view. The template used this variable to check if the user was authenticated, and if so, render the "Back to Profile" button. However, since the from_profile variable was missing in the context, the condition in the template couldn't be evaluated properly. By adding the line 'from_profile': True if request.user.is_authenticated else False to the context when rendering the template, the correct value was passed to the template, allowing it to conditionally render the appropriate button based on whether the user was logged in or not.
