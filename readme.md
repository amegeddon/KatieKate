#### Colour Accessibility

This webstore is designed with simplicity in mind, using a white background and black text to provide a high-contrast, readable experience. This design follows accessibility best practices to ensure that our content is easily readable by users, including those with visual impairments or color blindness.

This website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure compliance with accessibility standards. This helps ensure that the contrast between text and background meets the recommended ratios for readability, offering a better experience for users with various accessibility needs.


For further information on these guidelines, you can visit the following link. [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (w3.org)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
        

- ##### Colour Palette and Results
    - Text Colour 1 - [Coolors Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/084298-ffffff)<br>
    ![Contrast check of text colour 1 against Linen warm white background](images/colour-check.png)
    ![Contrast check of text colour 2 against Linen warm white background](images/colour-check1.png)


#### Typography
The main considerations for the font were aesthetics and accessibility. I chose the Lato font because of its modern and clean design, which is both visually appealing and highly readable. Lato is a widely used sans-serif font, developed by Google, ensuring good availability across a wide range of devices and platforms. This choice helps maintain a sleek, contemporary look while also ensuring accessibility for all users.

 - ##### Fallback Font

    The fallback fonts Arial and sans-serif were chosen to ensure consistent readability and a clean design in the event that the primary Lato font is unavailable. Arial is a widely available, highly legible sans-serif font, making it a reliable secondary option. The generic sans-serif ensures that, regardless of the user's device, the text will always be displayed in a clean, modern style.  


#### Imagery

  - ##### Welcome Image
    The welcome/hero image is from adobe stock images and has been properly licensed for use. 
    ![Welcome/hero image](images/AdobeStock_1214311757.jpeg)


  - #### Product Images
    All product images are the store owners own. 

All other imagery on the website are basic icons obtained from Font Awesome which can be found [here](https://fontawesome.com/).


### Wireframes

The wireframes for this project were hand-drawn, as I prefer to sketch my initial ideas to capture the overall structure and flow of the design. Whilst separate wireframes were not created for mobile and tablet, the layout is consistent across all screen sizes, ensuring a smooth responsive design.

### Future Features

Given additional time and resources, some future features I would like to incorporate into this upholstery website include:

- The ability to sign up and sign in using social accounts such as Google or Facebook for a quicker and more convenient registration process.
- I ran out of time to get a reviews on products functioning - this is something that I will do outside of the course, 
- A review restriction feature that ensures only customers who have purchased a product can leave a review for that item, ensuring authenticity and trust.
- A workshop section where the store owner can update and display information about upcoming upholstery courses, allowing customers to easily see when the next session will be available.
- An online upholstery calculator that allows customers to input their furniture dimensions and get an instant estimate for reupholstery services.

## Testing

Refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for details on all testing conducted.


## Deployment

The project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using a free relational database from [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). Before deploying to Heroku, I first set up the database, so the deployment process is explained in two parts.


### Heroku

1. To successfully deploy on Heroku we first to install some dependencies to that you can use Postgres on your deployed site. 

    ```bash
    pip3 install dj_database_url
    pip3 install psycopg2
    ```

2. We then need to create some files: a requirements.txt file and a Procfile.

3. The requirements.txt file contains all the applications and dependencies that are required to run the app. To create the requirements.txt file run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

4. The Procfile tells Heroku which files run the app and how to run it. To create the Procfile run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
     web: gunicorn [your app name].wsgi:application
    ```

5. If the Procfile has been created correctly it will have the Heroku logo next to it. It is also important to check the Procfile contents, as sometimes on creation a blank line will be added at the end of the file. This can sometimes cause problems when deploying to Heroku, so if the file contains a blank line at the end, delete this and save the file. Make sure to save both these files and then add, commit and push them to GitHub.

6. Login (or sign up) to [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).

7. Click the new button and then click create new app.

8. You will then be asked to give your app a name (these must be unique) and select a region. Once these are completed click create app.

9. You will now need to connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository for the site. Select GitHub in the deployment section, find the correct repository for the project and then click connect.

10. Once the repository is connected, you will need to provide Heroku some config variables it needs to build the app. Click on the settings tab and then click reveal config vars button. You will now need to add the environment key/value variables some of which were used in the env.py file and some of which will be different:

    | KEY | VALUE |
    | -- | -- |
    | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `your variable here if you have it already` |
    | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `your variable here if you have it already` |
    | DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1* |
    | DATABASE_URL | `your variable here`** |
    | EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `your variable here` |
    | EMAIL_HOST_USER | `your variable here` |
    | SECRET_KEY | `your variable here` |
    | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `your variable here` |
    | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `your variable here` |
    | STRIPE_WH_SECRET | `your variable here` |
    | USE_AWS | True |
    | DEVELOPMENT | True*** |

    *This is temporary and will be removed later.

    **This is where we paste our database url

    ***This variable is to be deleted once debugging is complete and you are ready to deploy your "production" app.

11. You then need to add the hostname of your Heroku app to settings.py which can be found in the Heroku settings tab under Domains.

    ```bash
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['https://katiekate-729242823673.herokuapp.com/', 'localhost']
    ```

12. We now need to migrate our database to our databse. Go to the top right hand of Heroku and select, more then select Run console. Type bash and click Run then type the following commands.

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate --plan
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
    
13. Assuming all your migrations were completed succesfully you can now create your superuser by running the below command and filling in your details.

      ```bash
      python3 manage.py createsuperuser    
      ```

14. Now that the relational database has been set up and the tables created and superuser created, we can now click open app and the application should now open in a new tab. If you haven't set up your AWS yet your CSS and images wont have loaded yet. We will set that up next.

### Amazon AWS

  #### Setting up an S3 Bucket
  1. Create an [Amazon AWS](aws.amazon.com) account

  2. Search for **S3** and create a new bucket
      - Allow public access
      - Acknowledge

  3. Under **Properties > Static** website hosting
      - Enable
      - `index.html` as index document
      - Save

  4. Under **Permissions > CORS** use:
      ```bash
          [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
                "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
                "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
                "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
      ]
      ```

  5. Under **Permissions > Bucket Policy**:
      - Generate Bucket Policy and take note of **Bucket ARN**
      - Chose **S3 Bucket Policy** as Type of Policy
      - For **Principal**, enter `*`
      - Enter **ARN** noted above
      - **Add Statement**
      - **Generate Policy**
      - Copy **Policy JSON Document**
      - Paste policy into **Edit Bucket policy** on the previous tab
      - Save changes

  6. Under **Access Control List (ACL)**:
      - For **Everyone (public access)**, tick **List**
      - Accept that everyone in the world may access the Bucket
      - Save changes

  #### Setting up AWS IAM
  1. From the **IAM dashboard** within AWS, select **User Groups**:
      - Create new group e.g. `manage-Katiekate`
      - Click through without adding a policy
      - **Create Group**

  2. Select **Policies**:
      - Create policy
      - Under **JSON** tab, click **Import managed policy**
      - Choose **AmazongS3FullAccess**
      - Edit the resource to include the **Bucket ARN** noted earlier when creating the Bucket Policy:

      ```bash
            "Resource": [
                            "arn:aws:s3:::katiekate",
                            "arn:aws:s3:::katiekate/*"
                  ]
      ```

      - Click **next step** and go to **Review policy**
      - Give the policy a name e.g. `katiekate-policy` and description
      - **Create policy**

  3. Go back to **User Groups** and choose the group created earlier
      - Under **Permissions > Add permissions**, choose **Attach Policies** and select the one just created
      - **Add permissions**

  4. Under **Users**:
      - Choose a user name e.g. `katiekate-staticfiles-user`
      - Select **Programmatic access** as the **Access type**
      - Click Next
      - Add the user to the Group just created
      - Click Next and **Create User**

  5. **Download the `.csv` containing the access key and secret access key. This will NOT be available to download again**

  #### Hooking Django up to S3

  1. Install boto3 and django-storages
      ```bash
      pip3 install boto3
      pip3 install django-storages
      pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
      ```

  2. Add the values from the `.csv` you downloaded to your Heroku Config Vars under Settings:
      ```bash
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      ```

  3. Delete the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` variable from your Config Vars and deploy your Heroku app, if you have enabled automatic deployment in Heroku this will happen automatically the next push you make to GitHub

  4. With your S3 bucket now set up, you can create a new folder called `media` (at the same level as the newly added `static` folder) and upload any required media files to it, making sure they are publicly accessible under **Permissions**


### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Login to GitHub.
2. Locate the repository, you can use a link you have been provided with or use the search function in the top left of the screen.
3. In the top right hand corner of the page locate and click the 'fork' button.
4. Near the bottom of the page click the green button that says 'Create Fork'.
5. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Login to GitHub.
2. Locate the repository, you can use a link you have been provided with or use the search function in the top left of the screen.
3. Near the top of the repository click the green 'Code' button.
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under HTTPS copy the link provided.
5. Open the terminal in your code editor. 
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
8. Press Enter. Your local clone should be created.
9. To install all the required dependencies you just need to run the following...
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
