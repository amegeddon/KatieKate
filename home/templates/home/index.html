    <p class="about-text">
        <span class="highlight">Katiekate & Co</span> was born from a deep desire to nurture creativity and breathe
        new life into forgotten treasures. I have always cherished family heirlooms—those items that carry with them
        stories, memories, and sentimental value. In a world that often prioritizes the new over the old, I find
        great joy in showing people how something once neglected—often tucked away in attics, sheds, or buried
        beneath piles of belongings—can be beautifully transformed into a bespoke, one-of-a-kind piece that holds
        meaning for them.
